#1 Hinna [hee-nah]
Hinna = To make it in time
When you struggle to make it on time, why use five words when you can use one? That’s Swedish efficiency right there. Maybe that’s part of the explanation why our companies are so successful? Because using the word hinna, makes it easier to hinna. Great word. Use it.

#2 Dygna [dyng-nah]
Dygna = Staying awake for 24 hours
You all know what we’re talking about. Sometimes you just have to dygna. Like when you’re a highly advanced procrastinator, and that deadline hits you right in the face. Like this: “Wow, you look tired, the bags under your eyes are huge” “Yes, I had to dygna because I couldn’t get that damn code to work”. We all have to dygna sometimes, so why not have a word for it? Let’s just use dygna from now on.

#3 Påtår [poe-t-oer]
Påtår = On toes
A very Swedish word, closely related to the fika. It basically means refill. But beware! It’s only applicable to coffee, but still very useful. Because if you work hard (like a swede) you need that constant flow of coffee. You need påtår. Especially if you decide to dygna. So come on world, let’s start using påtår.

#4 Tappa sugen [tap-ha sue-ghen]
Tappa sugen = Lose suction
Unfortunately it has nothing to do with suction. Tappa sugen is when you lose interest in something, or the craving to do something disappears. For instance: “Do you still wanna get a Fanta and doughnut after work?” “No, I have tappat sugen.” Amazing, right? Let’s just use tappa sugen instead.

#5 Vabba [vah-bah]
Vabba = Vabba (?)
 Alas it does not have a translation. Such a pity. Because it’s a word describing a situation when you can’t come to work because your child is home sick, but you still get payed from Försäkringskassan. For instance: “Wasn’t Staffan supposed to bring fika?” “He vabbar so we will have to settle for buy-cookies.” Pretty nice huh? Let’s just use vabba instead.

#6 Vobba [voh-bah]
Vobba = Vobba (?)
Vobba is almost like vabba, but with one small difference. When you vobba you’re taking care of your sick child, AND working from home. Multitasking at it’s very finest! Blow your kid’s nose and e-mail important clients at the same time. Great word.

#7 Vabruari [vab-rue-awrie]
Vabruari = Vabruari (?)
A wordplay with vabba and the month februari (February). Why? Because in February vabbing peaks. The reason is debated, but there are two main explanations: 1. A lot of kids get sick in February. 2. The Winter Olympics are in February and people use their kids as an excuse to watch cross country skiing. It’s a great word, no matter what.

#8 Mysfaktor [mees-factor]
Mysfaktor = The cosy factor
A room can have mysfaktor, a mood can have mysfaktor and a group of people can have mysfaktor. It’s the level of cosyness. And if you’re a workteam with creative ambition, you need a certain amount of mysfaktor in your workspace to come up with those groundbreaking ideas. Trust us. Abba, Spotify and Skype couldn’t have done it without some mysfaktor. Let’s add some mysfaktor to the world.

#9 Orka [orch-ah]
Orka = To be able to
Orka can mean “cope”. But also the opposite. Because it’s much a way of HOW you articulate it. Like “Wanna go for an afterwork?” “Orka”. In that case it means that you don’t have the energy or desire to do it. It’s pretty smart to have a word that means the opposite of itself. Right? Orka use orka? YES YOU DO! Let’s just use orka from now on.

#10 Fulsnygg [feul-snig]
Fulsnygg = Uglygoodlooking
Have you ever met a person that’s kind of ugly, yet weirdly attractive? Or seen a work of art that’s hideous, but you still like it? Well, then you’ve experienced something fulsnyggt. It’s basically when something is ugly in a way that makes it attractive. Fulsnyggness is everywhere. It needs a word! So come on world, let’s start using fulsnygg.

#11 Lördagsgodis [lurr-dahs-goh-dees]
Lördagsgodis = Saturday candy
It’s ok to eat cinnamon buns everyday at the five o’clock fika. The whole office does it. But when it comes to candy, we’re only allowed to eat it on Saturdays. Or at least according to this word, some of us cheat. But If you only eat candy on Saturdays you can binge all you want, without feeling guilty. The highlight of the week! Let’s use lördagsgodis from now on.

#12 Fika [feekha]
Fika = To have coffee and something to eat
The core of the Swedish mentality. If you ask a Swede “what’s the most Swedish thing?”, don’t be surprised if fika is the answer. So what’s the deal? Well, Swedes have fika all the time. A short break when you get together over coffee and something sweet. And for a Tinder date, it feels more safe to suggest a fika rather than that Wagner Opera or dinner with the parents. So come on world, let’s start using fika.

#13 After work [eiftur jawbhet]
After work = After work
In Swedish After work doesn’t mean the specific time after work. It’s when you go for a beer or a glass of wine, after work. Maybe it’s because we don’t want to say “grab a beer” or “hit the pub”, in case the boss would hear us. Or maybe it’s because drinks after work is something more than just drinks. It definitely deserves its own word.

#14 Dåndimpen [dawn-dimp-ehn]
Dåndimpen = When something makes you crazy
Like when your dry cleaner has miscoloured your best outfit. Or your most important pitch this year is being canceled, without any explanation. Or you get billed 15 euros for tap water. Dåndimpen is such a great word it gives you dåndimpen. You need it, don’t you?

#15 Duktig [dukh-tee]
Duktig = Good...
...And clever, and efficient, and capable, and smart, and useful. Well, it all comes down to one word: duktig. Duktig covers everything. That you’re good at what you do, that you did something really well or that you’re a hard worker. Whatever you want to say, simply say duktig.

#16 Spillevink [spiel-eh-veenk]
Spillevink = Overflow hint
That’s the direct translation, but it means nothing of that at all. Spillevink is used to describe a person who is fun, happy, inventive and creative, in a comic way. Every office needs a spillevink, someone who keeps up the moral with fun little escapades. Not all Swedes are spillevinks, but we sure appreciate them. And you should too. But! Then you need a word for it.

#17 Hen [hen]
Hen = Heshe/shehe
Swedes loves the word hen. And no, not the chickens hen. Hen is a “gender neutral third-person singular personal pronoun”. Or just hen, as we would say. Why do you need it? Because you don’t need people to know the gender of the person you’re talking about. It’s all a part of our Swedish openness, and now we want to share that with every hen out there.

#18 Snuskhummer [snask-humm-ehr]
Snuskhummer = Filthy lobster
A snuskhummer is a dirty old (in most cases) man. It’s a person with a dirty mind, that spends his/her time referring everything to sex. Almost every office has one or several snuskhummers. They exist everywhere, unfortunately. So you need the word snuskhummer to say: “Stop being such a snuskhummer”.

#19 Snackpåse [snack-paws-eh]
Snackpåse = Snack bag
Don’t be fooled! It has nothing to do with snacks. And if you realize it too late you might be stuck with the snackpåse forever. Because a snackpåse is someone who talks too much and all the time. It might be a client, a co-worker or the guy who sells falafel. Beware of the snackpåse, warn others of the snackpåse, and don’t be a snackpåse yourself. This word is obviously needed.

#20 Söndagsångest [sun-dawgs-ong-est]
Söndagsångest = Sunday night blues
Okey, who hasn’t experienced Sunday night blues? Or söndagsångest as the efficient Swedes call it. The feeling of anxiety about the week to come. The söndagsångest shouldn’t be too long, so simply use one word for it instead of three, and get it over with.

#21 Harkla [harr-clah]
Harkla = Clear your throat
Ahm, ahm. Before saying something you clear your throat, right? And here’s the thing again. We have one word for a very simple action. You have three. One is better than three. Harkla is better than “clear your throat”.

#22 Blunda [blun-dah]
Blunda = Close your eyes
Just blunda and let the power of the Swedish efficiency flow through you. It has two meanings: You blunda while you sleep (if you’re not one of those very scary people who sleep with their eyes open). And you can blunda for a certain issue, it’s when you pretend it’s not a real problem. “Don’t blunda for climate change”. Blunda is the word.

#23 Kaffe­gäsp [caff-ei-yesp]
Kaffegäsp = Coffee yawn
Kaffegäsp is a great word, especially if you’re a big coffee drinker (like most Swedes). Kaffegäsp is the tiredness that occurs at the time of the day when you usually have a coffee. Which means it’s time to have a fika break. Like: “I’m getting the kaffegäsp, time for a fika”. Every coffee drinker gets the kaffegäsp, so every coffee drinker needs a word for it.

#24 Hejhej [hei-hei]
Hejhej = Hellohello
Or tjenatjena, hallåhallå and tacktack. Swedes double their greetings and their thank you:s. Why? Because it’s a lot nicer to be double greeted and double thank-you:d. Try it on your next job-interview for instance! Double the niceness! Nicenice.

#25 Kramsnö [kram-sneu]
Kramsnö = Hug Snow
In Sweden we have a lot of snow, and we love snowball-fights. And making snow men. So we came up with a word for when the snow is super-easy to shape. The use of Kramsnö might not be obvious if you’re in like Singapore or Sao Paulo. But it’s still pretty cute. Don’t be surprised if the Swedes get homesick because it’s kramsnö in Sweden.

#26 Skadeglädje [skah-deh-gleh-dyeah]
Skadeglädje = Schadenfreude
German? What. No. Why use a German word, when we’ve proven to you that Swedish is an awesome language? We propose a swap: Switch Schadenfreude for Skadeglädje. More Swedish for everyone! And if you don’t know what skadeglädje means, it’s when you feel joy for someone else’s misfortune. The Muahahaha-feeling.

#27 Ombudsman [ohm-buds-man]
Ombudsman = Ombudsman
Oh, right! You already use our Swedish word here. Good for you! Now continue.

#28 Smörgåsbord [smoer-goes-board]
Smörgåsbord = Smorgasbord
Yes! You speak Swedish without even knowing it. Smorgasbord is super-Swedish. Keep up the good work!

#29 Tvättid [tvat-teed]
Tvättid = Wash time
Tvättid is the time when you have booked the laundry room. A sacred time for us, because it has to be respected. Otherwise you won’t get a new tvättid for two weeks and have to wash your clothes in the sink. The great thing about tvättid is that it is an excuse for everything: “I would love to, but i can’t. I have tvättid”. A very useful word.

#30 Jhu [inhale]
Jhu = Yes (sort of)
Don’t be surprised if a Swede does a sharp intake of breath that sounds like “Jhu” when you’re talking to them. And no, we’re not surprised or scared. We simply agree with you! It actually means “Yes” or “I agree”. A brilliant word/sound. Say schfuup to the word!

#31 Vaska [waskh-a]
Vaska = Pour expensive alcohol in the sink
When your business hits that unicorn-level, you might have so much money to spend that you have to be creative about it. The Swedes have a solution for this. We vaska expensive champagne, which means you order it at the club and ask the bartender to pour it in the sink. It’s so stupid it must have a word.

#32 Jobbig [jaw-big]
Jobbig = Worky
You might think it has something to do with work. It hasn’t. Because jobbig is when something or someone is annoying and blithering. So yeah, it could be a perfect word for work. So don’t be jobbig, start using jobbig.

#33 Blåsväder [bloes-vey-durr]
Blåsväder = Windy weather
Yep. Blåsväder is the term for when it’s windy outside. Nothing weird about that. But it also means that you end up in trouble, in an exposed situation. Big companies end up in blåsväder all the time, when they say or do something that is publically criticized. Like spill oil in the ocean and then talk about small people. So please, stay away from blåsväder. But start using blåsväder.

#34 Ovän [oo-van]
Ovän = Unfriend
No No. No. This is not something you can do on social media. An ovän is a person you don’t get along with. Almost like an enemy or a nemesis. The ovän simply doesn’t like you, and you don’t like her/him. Don’t become ovän with the wrong people though. You’ll never know when you might need a favor. A very handy word, let’s introduce the ovän to the world.

#35 Lagom [lah-ghom]
Lagom = Just right
Sweden – the country of lagom. It’s debated whether or not this word exists in the english language or. It basically means just right, or moderate. Not too much, not too little. Not to hot, not too cold. But we don’t think that any of these words does the job properly as a translation. And why have so many different versions? Just use lagom instead.
